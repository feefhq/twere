            It aspires to be a natural, everyday work tool which allows you to keep
            track of the things you're doing; the things you want to get done; a place
            to save snippets, links, ideas, aspirations. Over time, <span class='brand'>twere</span>
            will help you to curate everything you've <em>done</em>, to help you achieve what
            you really want to <em>do</em>.

            At the moment <span class='brand'>twere</span> is a very early proof of
            concept and is in a pre-alpha state. It should work in most modern desktop
            browsers, and mobile support will arrive soon.
            Do please try it out and contribute at

            The best way to use <span class='brand'>twere</span> is to keep it open in a
            tab throughout your day. Whatever you write will be saved on your device â€”

            <span class='brand'>twere</span> takes it's cues from many keyboard-focused
            applications. There is no <code>submit</code> button. When you're ready to
            save a note, hit <code>CTRL + ENTER</code> or <code>CMD + ENTER</code>. You can also use
            simple Markdown including <code>_</code>, <code>**</code>, <code>\`</code> and <code>\`\`\`</code>.

      There will be merit in putting a good preload strategy in place for assets.
      However, that's difficult while vendor implementations of JS module loading remain
      in flux. Lots of opportunities for making CSS more modular though.

      A simple, secure and unobtrusive journalling app.
    </h2>
    <h3>Simple</h3>
    <p>
      Capture the everyday things that you find, that you learn, that you do.
      Don't change <strong>what</strong> you do — change what you
      <strong>make</strong> of what you do.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Secure
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Your</strong> data is stored on <strong>your</strong> device
      — it goes nowhere without <strong>your</strong> say-so. No cookies, and
      no need to sign up or log in. You can even use it offline.
    </p>
    <h3>Unobtrusive</h3>
    <p>
      Designed to stay out of your way, but close to hand when you need it. An
      obsessively simple UI focuses on your keyboard, rather than clicks or
      taps.
